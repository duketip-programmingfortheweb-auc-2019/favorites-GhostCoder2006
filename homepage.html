                <p>The Heroes of Olympus is a series based on modern Greek and Roman mythology. There is a prophecy that states 'Seven 
                    halfbloods shall answer the call, To storm or fire, the world must fall. An oath to keep with the final breath, And foes
                    bear arms at the doors of death.</p>
                <p>In book one ,The Lost Hero, three demigods by the name of Jason Grace, Piper Mclean, and Leo Valdez
                     are taken to the greek demigod trainimg camp called Camp Half-Blood. While there, the Oracle of Delphi,
                     Rachel Dare, says a prophesy which takes them on a quest to rescue the Queen of the Gods, Hera, from one of
                     the giant sons of Gaia. On the way they encounter many obstacles, which slow down their journey.</p>
                <p>In book two, The Son of Neptune, a demigod named Percy Jackson has lost his memory and finds his way to the Roman training Camp called Camp

                     through them all using their skills and working together. When they come back, Percy's memory is completely
                     restored and they face a battle against one of the giants and his memory.</p>
