            <h3>Backstory:</h3>
                <p>Nico di Angelo lived in Italy until Zeus, the god of the Sky, kills his mother. His father Hades, the god of the dead
                    takes him and his older sister, Bianca di Angelo, to the Lotus Casino, which defies the laws of time, and
                     they unknowingly stay there for 70 years. They then eventually get to Camp Half-Blood, with Bianca now as
                     one of the immortal Hunters of Artemis. His sister goes on a quest and dies on the way. When Nico finds out he runs
                      away and figures out he is a son of Hades from the Ghost of King Minos, who betrays him and Nico become the Ghost King.
